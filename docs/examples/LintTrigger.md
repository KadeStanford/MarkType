# Lint Trigger Demo

This file intentionally contains markdown style issues to trigger `markdownlint` rules in the Lint Panel.

## Problems included

- Trailing spaces: this line has two trailing spaces after the period.
- Missing space after hash for header
  ##BadHeader

- Tabs instead of spaces:

  -     Indented item with tabs

- Multiple consecutive blank lines

- Line length that may violate rules: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

- Incorrect list marker style

* list item with asterisk when project prefers dashes

- No final newline at EOF (intentionally)
